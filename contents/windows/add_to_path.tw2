::Moving BINARY_NAME to PATH on Windows 10
# Moving the Exercism CLI to the right folder on Windows 10

To make the Exercism CLI usable on your computer, we need to move the `BINARY_NAME` executable file to the correct folder. Using the Command Prompt we just opened, we are going to open the folder.

## Step 1: Opening the right folder
### Exercise

In the Command Prompt window, copy & paste:

```
start "" "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps"
```

and hit the 'Enter' key.

### Verify

A new window, showing a folder, will show up. This is where we need to place the `BINARY_NAME` file. It will look something like this, but it might not be empty for you.

## Step 2: Moving the `BINARY_NAME` file
### Exercise

Find the `BINARY_NAME` file in the folder we opened earlier, when we downloaded `BINARY_NAME`. From this folder, drag the file (or copy & paste it) to the folder we just opened, labeled `WindowsApps`.

### Verify

In the `WindowsApps` folder, you should now see the `BINARY_NAME` file. It will look something like this:

## Step 3: Verify installation
### Exercise

Now that we moved the file, we need to check our installation. Open up the Command Prompt window again, and type (or copy & paste):

```
BINARY_NAME
```

and hit the 'Enter' key.

### Verify

After hitting the `Enter` key, the Command Prompt should reply with how the `BINARY_NAME` command can be used.
